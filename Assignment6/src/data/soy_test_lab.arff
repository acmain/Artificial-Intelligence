% 4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
%     There are 19 classes, only the first 15 of which have been used in prior
%     work.  The folklore seems to be that the last four classes are
%     unjustified by the data since they have so few examples.
%     There are 35 categorical attributes, some nominal and some ordered.  The
%     value ``dna'' means does not apply.  The values for attributes are
%     encoded numerically, with the first value encoded as ``0,'' the second as
%     ``1,'' and so forth.  An unknown values is encoded as ``?''.

% 5. Number of Instances: 683
